## Brand Voice (Comment Tone)

Warm and enthusiastic — like a fellow pottery-obsessed friend. Not salesy. Curious about other makers' processes. Encouraging to beginners, respectful to pros.

**Tone examples:**
- "The glaze on this is unreal, what cone did you fire at?"
- "This is exactly why pottery > doomscrolling"
- "Ok this makes me want to throw everything and start over, it's perfect"
- "My hands are itching to get on the wheel after seeing this"
